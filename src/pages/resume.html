        <p>
          Highly motivated and detail-orientated, emerging from the fast-paced and customer centric hospitality
          industry. From directing events I’ve leveraged great networking and interpersonal skills from vendors,
          customers and stakeholders. I am a real end-to-end project manager who will strive to know the ins
          and outs of all elements to provide true team support. My career goal is to assume responsibility for
          projects that connect with their audience, working for a leading company whom I share similar values.
